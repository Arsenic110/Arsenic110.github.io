                <p>
                    This is the last official<sup>TM</sup> lab! We will probably still meet again a few times to finish up tasks, but this at least is the last thursday before submission. Currently, I have a few admin tasks remaining, including recording a trailer. Our game now has a title screen, where we include the ULCGD logo and the little disclaimer ("This game was developed by Students at the University"). We also have a credits menu with placeholder names. I asked Peace to do this on Monday particularly as it was a priority, as we need to put the credits & that disclaimer in the game somewhere.

                    As for the progress of the rest of the team, Pedro & Lucretia worked on sound effects. They booked a room in the library with sound equipment, and got Pedro to read out voicelines, which were then mixed and edited to be put in game as a kind of robotic voice. I think the idea is really cool and fits the robotic theme of the game. Leo is working on his mapgen system; while it is not ready yet, we can begin making the actual map prefabs. Cian will be working on that with direction from Pedro. Misha was working on adding a few new enemies to the game, including the swordfish inspired humanoid and a crocodile-shark hybrid. I drew these on Monday.
